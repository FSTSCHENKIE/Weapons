# Inferno Collection: Weapons
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Weapons.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Weapons)

__Public Alpha Version 1.1__

Adds fire modes to the weapons of your choice, as well as more realistic reloads (including disabling automatic reloads), more blood when injured, and limping after being injured.

Presently, the following can be customized:
- Which weapons have what fire mode.
- Which weapons do and do not have a reticle.
